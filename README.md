# ft_printf ✅

Welcome to **ft_printf**, a project where I recreated the famous `printf` function in C.  

## Features

The **ft_printf** function supports the following features:

- Common conversions:
  - `%c` : character  
  - `%s` : string  
  - `%d` / `%i` : signed integer  
  - `%u` : unsigned integer  
  - `%x` / `%X` : hexadecimal (lowercase/uppercase)  
  - `%p` : pointer  
  - `%%` : to print `%`  

- Handling of precision and width for supported conversions.
